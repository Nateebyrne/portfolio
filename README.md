## Description

The portfolio features a condensed navigation menu on the left-hand side, a vertical footer navigation based on feedback from the UX course, and some slight image swaps for improved aesthetics.

## Adjustments

- Condensed navigation menu on the left-hand side
- Vertical footer navigation
- Image swaps for better visual appeal

## Fonts and Libraries

- Google Fonts: Inter and Roboto Serif
- CSS Libraries: Bootstrap and Bulma

## Image Licensing

Some images are licensed from Adobe Stock Images to fit well with the theme and have no use restrictions.

## Accessibility

- Aria roles are spread out among the code.
- The tab feature works seamlessly with the navigation.
- Only errors in validation are double classes, removal causes extra dead space above banner
